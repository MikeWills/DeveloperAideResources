Here I will outline some of the standard procedures that was use to streamline development processes.

## Source Versioning Branches

By now you should at least have heard the terms "trunk" and "branch". (If you still have questions, talk to me.) Most of our projects now have a trunck and at least one branch. The trunk is always production-ready code. I should be able to publish this project without fear of a half completed project. The only exeception to this if this is a new application or website. 

1. Create a personal branch of the project.
2. Name the branch with your name and the ticket number if applicible. In the case of the Portal, we have a branch with our name and sub branches off our names for the updates.
